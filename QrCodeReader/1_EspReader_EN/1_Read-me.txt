COMPONENTS: 

 - ESP32-CAM 
 - 5V POWER SUPPLY
 - I2C DISPLAY LCD 16x02 

***TIPS:

- To program the ESP-CAM, it'll be necessary to use a USB converter to the microcontroller, as it doesn't come with a built-in USB converter. If you have an Arduino or another compatible board, you can use it as a converter and program the ESP through the other micro. I used an Arduino Mega, see the connections bellow:

ESP32-CAM  =>   ARDUINO       
5V                  =>      5V          
GND              =>      GND        
UOT              =>       1(TX)       
UnR               =>       0(RX)        
IO0 and GND  | RESET and GND  (on the board itself, not between them)

- If you want to send the data to a server, just change the variable "serverName"
value to:

https://www.address.com.br/folder/file.php

- If you want to send the data to a localhost, just change the variable "serverName"
value to:

http://IPaddress/folder/file.php
